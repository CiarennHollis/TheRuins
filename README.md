# The Ruins
This is where I'll back up and record the development process of my single player level map for Quake, The Ruins.
* Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/CiarennHollis/TheRuins/wiki) for more information on the development and production of this map.

## Working Notes
* Have the walkway behind the pillars extend all the way around the temple but have the sides blocked off by rubble and what not -> the player can see through to the other side (they'll be able to see the pavilion but they can't get to it yet.
